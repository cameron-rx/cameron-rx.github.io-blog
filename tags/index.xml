      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-reason-for-this-blog&#34;&gt;The Reason for this blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year I decided that I had been wasting a lot of my time doing meaningless consuming of content that was filling the majority of my time and not giving me much enjoyment. This was mainly binge watching youtube videos or tv shows;reading random posts on reddit; scrollling through social media (luckily managed to see the negatives of tiktok early and have had that deleted from my phone for about a year now. Since realising this I have decided I am going to reduce the time I spend doing these useless activities and be more mindfull of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-goal&#34;&gt;The Goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each month I want to assign myself a goal that I will work towards and write about my experiences doing it in this blog. This blog itself is in fact my goal for the month of february since I believe commiting to writing about my progress in these goals will help to motivate me to see them through. I will perhaps spend some time writing about other thoughts I have on productivity, programming (currently studying computer science at The University of Sheffield) and life in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;its-time-to-reclaim-my-life&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to reclaim my life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention in my english lessons at school so please forgive me if my writing is hard or not interesting it is a skill I hope to improve as well. My next couple of posts will probably detail me working on this blog for the rest of the month and a review of my goal for january which was taking part in dry jan.&lt;/p&gt;
